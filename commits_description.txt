Learned about get keyword while writing function for formattedDate.

Commit 8:
Wrote a function for displaying bottomModelSheet after clicking on the icon in the appbar.
Learned the concept of "context" argument.
We get a context automatically as a input to build method. It is passed to build method by flutter.
If our inner class extends a state then flutter automatically add a context property to the class,
more specifically this property is provided by the state parent class.
This context property made available by flutter can be used in showModelBottomSheet() method.

IMPORTANT:
What is context => Context is basically an object full of metadata managed by flutter that belongs to the specific widget.
So every widget has its specific context and that contains metadata information related to the widget and the widget's position in the overall user interface.
